# Speech-to-Text-using-OpenAI
# Speech to Text using OpenAI whisper-1 model

We need to install the following dependencies before we jump into the coding part:
1. openai
2. docx
3. python-docx
4. pydub

We need to import the following librraies before we start converting the speeech to text:
1. import openai
2. from docx import Document
3. from pydub import AudioSegment
4. import csv

We should also create a API keys from OepanAI website for autheticating and using their APIs or pretrained models
https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys
if you don't have a API key in this section create a new one. Try to remember or note down the API key otherwise we need to create a new one for next service call.
